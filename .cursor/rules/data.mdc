# Data Development Guidelines

## Core Philosophy

This is a pure JavaScript, web browser-only app.
- All data is served / imported as part of a static app.
- That means all of our tools are in-browser tools.
- There is no remote backend, and our use of data should be available offline. (The only exception to this is fetching embedding or chat models and storing locally).

## Database

We use [Orama](https://docs.oramasearch.com/docs/orama-js) for all database and search functionality. Orama is a full-text search engine that runs entirely in the browser, which aligns with our browser-only architecture.

### Key Points
- All database operations happen client-side using Orama JS
- No backend database server required - everything runs in the browser
- Search indexes are built and maintained in-memory
- Data persistence is handled through browser storage mechanisms (localStorage, IndexedDB, etc.)
- Refer to the [Orama JS documentation](https://docs.oramasearch.com/docs/orama-js) for API details and usage patterns
